/*
Write a Java program that provides temperature-related advice to the user. The program will
take the temperature in Celsius as input, offer clothing advice for different temperature ranges:
1. If the input temperature is within a reasonable range (e.g., between -20째C and 40째C) and
display an error message if the input is invalid.
2. If the temperature is less than 5 degrees Celsius, advise the user to wear a heavy coat and
gloves.
3. If the temperature is between 5 and 15 degrees Celsius (inclusive), advise the user to wear
a jacket and a hat.
4. For temperatures between 16 and 25 degrees Celsius (inclusive), recommend wearing a
light jacket.
5. For temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius, advise the user to wear t-shirt and sunglasses.
